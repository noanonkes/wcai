## The command-line interface

Interaction with a computer is typically done through a graphical user interface (GUI). With a GUI, instructions are sent to the computer by clicking a mouse and interacting with menus. GUIs are often designed to be used intuitively, and basic interaction with one can be done from the first moment a user sees it. However, this way of delivering instructions to a computer involves a lot of user interaction, which can greatly reduce productivity and is prone to user-error.

Imagine the following task: for a literature search, you have to copy the third line of one thousand text files in one thousand different directories and paste it into a single file. Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking at your desk for several hours, but you could potentially also commit an error in the process of completing this repetitive task.

In such tasks we can take advantage of a Unix shell, which is often referred to as a terminal. A Unix shell is both a command-line interface (CLI) and a scripting language. With the proper commands, the shell enables us to repeat specific tasks with or without modification as many times as we would want. The task we describe above can be completed in seconds using the shell.

### Using the terminal

During the installation of the software we use in our courses you have watched a video on how to use the Mac OS terminal. In the exercises below you will practice the very basics of the terminal. Don't worry; the exercises won't be as intricate as the task described in the example above.

> You don’t have to hand in these practice exercises. They’re here for you to test yourself.

This is where we take advantage of the Unix shell. The Unix shell is both a command-line interface (CLI) and a scripting language, allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast. With the proper commands, the shell can repeat tasks with or without some modification as many times as we want. Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be accomplished in seconds.
