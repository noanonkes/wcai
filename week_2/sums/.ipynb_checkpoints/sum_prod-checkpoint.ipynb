    "In Machine Learning you will often come across a slightly different sum equation, wherein variable values are taken from a list-like structure. These structures are actually named vectors, or matrices, but you will learn about those in a couple of weeks. For now, all that is important is that they function in much the same way as lists. An equation with a sum might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum^N_i x_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Wherein $x$ is a list of length $N$, and $i$ is the index of an element in the list $x$. The equation above sums all elements in a list named $x$. _Note that the start value of $i$ is not given. When this is the case, you can assume the first value to be 1._\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalent given a list of values named `x` in code looks as follows:\n",
